# Command Line Conjugator

Show conjugations for a given verb.  You can use [cabal](https://cabal.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to run the command from the project root:

    cabal run conjugate <verb>

Or alternatively, you can install it locally:


    cabal install

Then you can run it as follows from anywhere:

    conjugate <verb>

Right now it only shows verbs in spanish.  Other languages to be added later.
